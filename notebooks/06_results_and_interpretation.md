# Phase 6: Results Interpretation and Conclusions

This document summarizes the key findings from the modeling analysis and provides
a high-level interpretation of the results.

## Purpose of This Phase

The purpose of this phase was to interpret the statistical modeling results in a
clear and meaningful way, focusing on what the findings suggest about daily
activity patterns and depression.

Rather than optimizing predictive performance, the emphasis was on understanding
behavioral differences captured by wearable data.

---

## Key Findings

The analysis revealed several consistent patterns:

- Participants in the condition group tended to show **higher levels of inactivity**
  compared to controls
- Activity patterns in the condition group were **more irregular and fragmented**
  across the day
- Clear day–night activity rhythms were less pronounced in individuals with depression
- Greater disruption in activity patterns was associated with higher depression
  severity scores

These findings were consistent across multiple modeling approaches.

## Interpretation

The results suggest that depression is associated with measurable changes in
everyday activity behavior, including reduced activity levels and disrupted
daily rhythms.

Importantly, these patterns were captured using **passively collected wearable
data**, without the need for self-report or clinical observation.

## Conclusions

This project demonstrates that simple, interpretable features derived from
actigraphy data can reflect meaningful behavioral differences related to
depression.

Such wearable-based measures have the potential to support mental health research
by providing objective, continuous insights into daily behavior and symptom
severity.

Future work could extend this approach to longitudinal prediction, larger
datasets, or integration with additional physiological signals.
